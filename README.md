# Hello! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm **Nisrina Febriyanti** âœ¨  
An Information Systems grad with a passion for crafting digital products that aren't just functional, but also spark joy, ignite curiosity, and (fingers crossed!) sprinkle a little bit of positive impact into someone's day. Think of me as a digital alchemist, turning raw ideas into delightful and genuinely useful solutions.ðŸŒ™

ðŸŒ± I'm currently building my resume and digital garden.
